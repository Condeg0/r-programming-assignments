# --- 1. Base R Graphics ---

# Plot 1: Time series of S&P 500 daily returns
# This plot is essential for visualizing volatility clusters and market shocks.

# Objective: Create layered visuals using the grammar of graphics.

# Plot 4: Faceted histogram of returns by year
# This provides a more detailed view of the annual return distributions than the boxplot.
